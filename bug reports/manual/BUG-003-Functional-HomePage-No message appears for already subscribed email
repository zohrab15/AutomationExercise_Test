# Bug ID: BUG-003 
## Test Type: Functional  
## Module: Home Page  
## Description: No error or info message is shown when a user enters an already subscribed email.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Home page page.
2. Enter an email address that has already been subscribed (e.g., `test@example.com`).
3. Click the "Subscribe" button.
4. Observe the result.

### Expected Result:
- A clear message should be displayed, such as:
  - "This email is already subscribed."
  - or "You are already subscribed."

### Actual Result:
- No message is displayed. The form gives no feedback to the user, and the subscription process appears unresponsive.

### Notes:
- This prevents test cases related to duplicate email validation from being executed.
- Issue was encountered in Google Chrome.
- Possibly due to a missing frontend validation or unhandled backend response.

### Severity: Medium  
### Priority: Medium
