---

## 🔁 Steps to Reproduce

2. Enter an email address that has already been subscribed (e.g., `test@example.com`).  
3. Click the "Subscribe" button.  
4. Observe the result.

## ✅ Expected Result

- A clear message should be displayed, such as:  
  - "This email is already subscribed."  
  - or "You are already subscribed."

---

## ❌ Actual Result
